# Hotel-Booking-Project
Due to substantial cancellation rates, the owners of the City Hotel and Resort Hotel is witnessing a notable decline in guest bookings, resulting in numerous unoccupied rooms that are significantly affecting the business.

In this project, I thoroughly examined the cancellation rate for two hotel bookings and presented valuable insights through the utilization of graphs and recommendations. My intention was to provide the necessary information to facilitate optimal decision-making.

I will have to help the Hotel owners to address this issue using data analysis and provide possible solutions to problems like:
1. What are the key factors that contribute to hotel reservation cancellations?
2. What strategies can be implemented to enhance the management of hotel reservation cancellations?
3. In what ways can hotels receive support in making pricing and promotion decisions?
